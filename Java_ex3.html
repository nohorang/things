    <p>
        <span id="first" class="js">JavaScript</span>, often abbreviated as JS, is <strong>a
                programming language</strong> that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML
            and
            CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use <span class="js">JavaScript</span> on the client side for webpage behavior,
                often incorporating
                third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engine to
                    execute the code on users'
                    devices.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the
            ECMAScript standard.[10] It
            has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
            supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming
            interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the
            Document
            Object Model (DOM).
