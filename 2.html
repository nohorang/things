    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia css">Cascading Style Sheets
            (CSS)</a> is <strong>a style sheet language</strong> used for describing the presentation of a document
        written
        in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a
        cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
    <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3]
        This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
        presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
        separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file
        to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
    <p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles
        for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen
        reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is
        accessed on a mobile device.</p>
